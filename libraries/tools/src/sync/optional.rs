/// Basically a [`RwLock<Option<Arc<T>>>`] - the benefits here being:
/// 1. This structure is [`Sync`] in that it can be shared between threads
/// 2. This structure can be lazily initialized, and then reset back to [`None`], and back again
/// 3. This structure provides multiple access to a single shared instance, like a [`String`] so we're
///    not cloning it a bunch of times unnecessarily.  ([`Arc<T>`])
///
/// The [`Arc<T>`] bit is because you can't return a `&T` out of a [`RwLock<T>`] the way you can
/// from a [`std::sync::OnceLock<T>`].  The only reason this isn't a OnceLock is because I wanted
/// a `swap` method that was atomic, rather than relying on a [`std::sync::OnceLock<T>::take`]
/// followed by a [`std::sync::OnceLock<T>::set`], which allows a very slight race condition.
