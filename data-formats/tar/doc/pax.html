<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_92_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>pax</i> utility shall read, write, and write lists of the members of archive files and copy directory hierarchies. A
variety of archive formats shall be supported; see the <b>-x</b> <i>format</i> option.</p>

<p>The action to be taken depends on the presence of the <b>-r</b> and <b>-w</b> options. The four combinations of <b>-r</b> and
<b>-w</b> are referred to as the four modes of operation: <b>list</b>, <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, and <b>copy</b> modes,
corresponding respectively to the four forms shown in the SYNOPSIS section.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>list</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>list</b> mode (when neither <b>-r</b> nor <b>-w</b> are specified), <i>pax</i> shall write the names of the members of
the archive file read from the standard input, with pathnames matching the specified patterns, to standard output. If a named file
is of type directory, the file hierarchy rooted at that file shall be listed as well.</dd>

<dt><b>read</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>read</b> mode (when <b>-r</b> is specified, but <b>-w</b> is not), <i>pax</i> shall extract the members of the archive
file read from the standard input, with pathnames matching the specified patterns. If an extracted file is of type directory, the
file hierarchy rooted at that file shall be extracted as well. The extracted files shall be created performing pathname resolution
with the directory in which <i>pax</i> was invoked as the current working directory. 

<p>If an attempt is made to extract a directory when the directory already exists, this shall not be considered an error. If an
attempt is made to extract a FIFO when the FIFO already exists, this shall not be considered an error.</p>

<p>The ownership, access, and modification times, and file mode of the restored files are discussed under the <b>-p</b> option.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>write</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>write</b> mode (when <b>-w</b> is specified, but <b>-r</b> is not), <i>pax</i> shall write the contents of the
<i>file</i> operands to the standard output in an archive format. If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, a list of files to
copy, one per line, shall be read from the standard input and each entry in this list shall be processed as if it had been a
<i>file</i> operand on the command line. A file of type directory shall include all of the files in the file hierarchy rooted at
the file.</dd>

<dt><b>copy</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>copy</b> mode (when both <b>-r</b> and <b>-w</b> are specified), <i>pax</i> shall copy the <i>file</i> operands to the
destination directory. 

<p>If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, a list of files to copy, one per line, shall be read from the standard input. A file
of type directory shall include all of the files in the file hierarchy rooted at the file.</p>

<p>The effect of the <b>copy</b> shall be as if the copied files were written to a <i>pax</i> format archive file and then
subsequently extracted, except that copying of sockets may be supported even if archiving them in write mode is not supported, and
that there may be hard links between the original and the copied files. If the destination directory is a subdirectory of one of
the files to be copied, the results are unspecified. If the destination directory is a file of a type not defined by the System
Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2017, the results are implementation-defined; otherwise, it shall be an error for the file named by
the <i>directory</i> operand not to exist, not be writable by the user, or not be a file of type directory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b> modes, if intermediate directories are necessary to extract an archive member, <i>pax</i> shall
perform actions equivalent to the <a href="../functions/mkdir.html"><i>mkdir</i>()</a> function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of POSIX.1-2017, called with the following arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The intermediate directory used as the <i>path</i> argument</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as the <i>mode</i> argument</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If any specified <i>pattern</i> or <i>file</i> operands are not matched by at least one file or archive member, <i>pax</i> shall
write a diagnostic message to standard error for each one that did not match and exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The archive formats described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section shall be automatically detected on input. The default output
archive format shall be implementation-defined.</p>

<p>A single archive can span multiple files. The <i>pax</i> utility shall determine, in an implementation-defined manner, what file
to read or write as the next file.</p>

<p>If the selected archive format supports the specification of linked files, it shall be an error if these files cannot be linked
when the archive is extracted. For archive formats that do not store file contents with each name that causes a hard link, if the
file that contains the data is not extracted during this <i>pax</i> session, either the data shall be restored from the original
file, or a diagnostic message shall be displayed with the name of a file that can be used to extract the data. In traversing
directories, <i>pax</i> shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the
last file visited. When it detects an infinite loop, <i>pax</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall
terminate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_92_04"></a>OPTIONS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>pax</i> utility shall conform to XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02"><i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i></a>
, except that the order of presentation of the <b>-o</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-s</b> options is significant.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-r</b></dt>

<dd>Read an archive file from standard input.</dd>

<dt><b>-w</b></dt>

<dd>Write files to the standard output in the specified archive format.</dd>

<dt><b>-a</b></dt>

<dd>Append files to the end of the archive. It is implementation-defined which devices on the system support appending. Additional
file formats unspecified by this volume of POSIX.1-2017 may impose restrictions on appending.</dd>

<dt><b>-b&nbsp;</b> <i>blocksize</i></dt>

<dd>Block the output at a positive decimal integer number of bytes per write to the archive file. Devices and archive formats may
impose restrictions on blocking. Blocking shall be automatically determined on input. Conforming applications shall not specify a
<i>blocksize</i> value larger than 32256. Default blocking when creating archives depends on the archive format. (See the <b>-x</b>
option below.)</dd>

<dt><b>-c</b></dt>

<dd>Match all file or archive members except those specified by the <i>pattern</i> or <i>file</i> operands.</dd>

<dt><b>-d</b></dt>

<dd>Cause files of type directory being copied or archived or archive members of type directory being extracted or listed to match
only the file or archive member itself and not the file hierarchy rooted at the file.</dd>

<dt><b>-f&nbsp;</b> <i>archive</i></dt>

<dd>Specify the pathname of the input or output archive, overriding the default standard input (in <b>list</b> or <b>read</b>
modes) or standard output (<b>write</b> mode).</dd>

<dt><b>-H</b></dt>

<dd>If a symbolic link referencing a file of type directory is specified on the command line, <i>pax</i> shall archive the file
hierarchy rooted in the file referenced by the link, using the name of the link as the root of the file hierarchy. Otherwise, if a
symbolic link referencing a file of any other file type which <i>pax</i> can normally archive is specified on the command line,
then <i>pax</i> shall archive the file referenced by the link, using the name of the link. The default behavior, when neither
<b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> are specified, shall be to archive the symbolic link itself.</dd>

<dt><b>-i</b></dt>

<dd>Interactively rename files or archive members. For each archive member matching a <i>pattern</i> operand or file matching a
<i>file</i> operand, a prompt shall be written to the file <b>/dev/tty</b>. The prompt shall contain the name of the file or
archive member, but the format is otherwise unspecified. A line shall then be read from <b>/dev/tty</b>. If this line is blank, the
file or archive member shall be skipped. If this line consists of a single period, the file or archive member shall be processed
with no modification to its name. Otherwise, its name shall be replaced with the contents of the line. The <i>pax</i> utility shall
immediately exit with a non-zero exit status if end-of-file is encountered when reading a response or if <b>/dev/tty</b> cannot be
opened for reading and writing. 

<p>The results of extracting a hard link to a file that has been renamed during extraction are unspecified.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>-k</b></dt>

<dd>Prevent the overwriting of existing files.</dd>

<dt><b>-l</b></dt>

<dd>(The letter ell.) In <b>copy</b> mode, hard links shall be made between the source and destination file hierarchies whenever
possible. If specified in conjunction with <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b>, when a symbolic link is encountered, the hard link created in
the destination file hierarchy shall be to the file referenced by the symbolic link. If specified when neither <b>-H</b> nor
<b>-L</b> is specified, when a symbolic link is encountered, the implementation shall create a hard link to the symbolic link in
the source file hierarchy or copy the symbolic link to the destination.</dd>

<dt><b>-L</b></dt>

<dd>If a symbolic link referencing a file of type directory is specified on the command line or encountered during the traversal of
a file hierarchy, <i>pax</i> shall archive the file hierarchy rooted in the file referenced by the link, using the name of the link
as the root of the file hierarchy. Otherwise, if a symbolic link referencing a file of any other file type which <i>pax</i> can
normally archive is specified on the command line or encountered during the traversal of a file hierarchy, <i>pax</i> shall archive
the file referenced by the link, using the name of the link. The default behavior, when neither <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> are
specified, shall be to archive the symbolic link itself.</dd>

<dt><b>-n</b></dt>

<dd>Select the first archive member that matches each <i>pattern</i> operand. No more than one archive member shall be matched for
each pattern (although members of type directory shall still match the file hierarchy rooted at that file).</dd>

<dt><b>-o&nbsp;</b> <i>options</i></dt>

<dd>Provide information to the implementation to modify the algorithm for extracting or writing files. The value of <i>options</i>
shall consist of one or more &lt;comma&gt;-separated keywords of the form: 

<pre>
<i>keyword</i><b>[[</b><tt>:</tt><b>]</b><tt>=</tt><i>value</i><b>][</b><tt>,</tt><i>keyword</i><b>[[</b><tt>:</tt><b>]</b><tt>=</tt><i>value</i><b>]</b><tt>, ...</tt><b>]</b>
</pre>

<p>Some keywords apply only to certain file formats, as indicated with each description. Use of keywords that are inapplicable to
the file format being processed produces undefined results.</p>

<p>Keywords in the <i>options</i> argument shall be a string that would be a valid portable filename as described in XBD <a href=
"../basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_282"><i>Portable Filename Character Set</i></a>. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>Keywords are not expected to be filenames, merely to follow the same character composition rules as portable filenames.</dd>
</dl>

<basefont size="3"> 

<p>Keywords can be preceded with white space. The <i>value</i> field shall consist of zero or more characters; within <i>value</i>,
the application shall precede any literal &lt;comma&gt; with a &lt;backslash&gt;, which shall be ignored, but preserves the
&lt;comma&gt; as part of <i>value</i>. A &lt;comma&gt; as the final character, or a &lt;comma&gt; followed solely by white space as
the final characters, in <i>options</i> shall be ignored. Multiple <b>-o</b> options can be specified; if keywords given to these
multiple <b>-o</b> options conflict, the keywords and values appearing later in command line sequence shall take precedence and the
earlier shall be silently ignored. The following keyword values of <i>options</i> shall be supported for the file formats as
indicated:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>delete</b>=<i>pattern</i></dt>

<dd>
(Applicable only to the <b>-x</b> <b>pax</b> format.) When used in <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall omit from
extended header records that it produces any keywords matching the string pattern. When used in <b>read</b> or <b>list</b> mode,
<i>pax</i> shall ignore any keywords matching the string pattern in the extended header records. In both cases, matching shall be
performed using the pattern matching notation described in <a href="../utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_13_01"><i>Patterns Matching
a Single Character</i></a> and <a href="../utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_13_02"><i>Patterns Matching Multiple Characters</i></a>
. For example: 

<pre>
<tt>-o</tt> <b>delete</b><tt>=</tt><i>security</i><tt>.*
</tt>
</pre>

<p>would suppress security-related information. See <a href="#tag_20_92_13_03">pax Extended Header</a> for extended header record
keyword usage.</p>

<p>When multiple <b>-o</b> <b>delete=pattern</b> options are specified, the patterns shall be additive; all keywords matching the
specified string patterns shall be omitted from extended header records that <i>pax</i> produces.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>exthdr.name</b>=<i>string</i></dt>

<dd>
(Applicable only to the <b>-x</b> <b>pax</b> format.) This keyword allows user control over the name that is written into the
<b>ustar</b> header blocks for the extended header produced under the circumstances described in <a href="#tag_20_92_13_02">pax
Header Block</a>. The name shall be the contents of <i>string</i>, after the following character substitutions have been made:

<p>Any other <tt>'%'</tt> characters in <i>string</i> produce undefined results.</p>

<p>If no <b>-o</b> <b>exthdr.name=string</b> is specified, <i>pax</i> shall use the following default value:</p>

<pre>

</tt>
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><b>globexthdr.name</b>=<i>string</i></dt>

<dd>
(Applicable only to the <b>-x</b> <b>pax</b> format.) When used in <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> mode with the appropriate options,
<i>pax</i> shall create global extended header records with <b>ustar</b> header blocks that will be treated as regular files by
previous versions of <i>pax</i>. This keyword allows user control over the name that is written into the <b>ustar</b> header blocks
for global extended header records. The name shall be the contents of string, after the following character substitutions have been

<p>where $ <i>TMPDIR</i> represents the value of the <i>TMPDIR</i> environment variable. If <i>TMPDIR</i> is not set, <i>pax</i>
shall use <b>/tmp</b>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>invalid</b>=<i>action</i></dt>

<dd>
(Applicable only to the <b>-x</b> <b>pax</b> format.) This keyword allows user control over the action <i>pax</i> takes upon
encountering values in an extended header record that, in <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, are invalid in the destination hierarchy
or, in <b>list</b> mode, cannot be written in the codeset and current locale of the implementation. The following are invalid
values that shall be recognized by <i>pax</i>: 

<ul>
<li>
<p>In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, a filename or link name that contains character encodings invalid in the destination
hierarchy. (For example, the name may contain embedded NULs.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, a filename or link name that is longer than the maximum allowed in the destination hierarchy
(for either a pathname component or the entire pathname).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In <b>list</b> mode, any character string value (filename, link name, user name, and so on) that cannot be written in the
codeset and current locale of the implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following mutually-exclusive values of the <i>action</i> argument are supported:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>binary</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>write</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall generate a <b>hdrcharset</b>=<b>BINARY</b> extended header record for each file with a
filename, link name, group name, owner name, or any other field in an extended header record that cannot be translated to the UTF-8
codeset, allowing the archive to contain the files with unencoded extended header record values. In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b>
mode, <i>pax</i> shall use the values specified in the header without translation, regardless of whether this may overwrite an
existing file with a valid name. In <b>list</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall behave identically to the <b>bypass</b> action.</dd>

<dt><b>bypass</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall bypass the file, causing no change to the destination hierarchy. In
<b>list</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall write all requested valid values for the file, but its method for writing invalid values is
unspecified.</dd>

<dt><b>rename</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall act as if the <b>-i</b> option were in effect for each file with invalid
filename or link name values, allowing the user to provide a replacement name interactively. In <b>list</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall
behave identically to the <b>bypass</b> action.</dd>

<dt><b>UTF-8</b></dt>

<dd>When used in <b>read</b>, <b>copy</b>, or <b>list</b> mode and a filename, link name, owner name, or any other field in an
extended header record cannot be translated from the <b>pax</b> UTF-8 codeset format to the codeset and current locale of the
implementation, <i>pax</i> shall use the actual UTF-8 encoding for the name. If a <b>hdrcharset</b> extended header record is in
effect for this file, the character set specified by that record shall be used instead of UTF-8. If a
<b>hdrcharset</b>=<b>BINARY</b> extended header record is in effect for this file, no translation shall be performed.</dd>

<dt><b>write</b></dt>

<dd>In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall write the file, translating the name, regardless of whether this may
overwrite an existing file with a valid name. In <b>list</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall behave identically to the <b>bypass</b>
action.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If no <b>-o</b> <b>invalid=option</b> is specified, <i>pax</i> shall act as if <b>-o</b> <b>invalid=bypass</b> were specified.
Any overwriting of existing files that may be allowed by the <b>-o</b> <b>invalid=</b> actions shall be subject to permission (
<b>-p</b>) and modification time (<b>-u</b>) restrictions, and shall be suppressed if the <b>-k</b> option is also specified.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>linkdata</b></dt>

<dd>
(Applicable only to the <b>-x</b> <b>pax</b> format.) In <b>write</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall write the contents of a file to the
archive even when that file is merely a hard link to a file whose contents have already been written to the archive.</dd>

<dt><b>listopt</b>=<i>format</i></dt>

<dd>
This keyword specifies the output format of the table of contents produced when the <b>-v</b> option is specified in <b>list</b>
mode. See <a href="#tag_20_92_04_01">List Mode Format Specifications</a>. To avoid ambiguity, the <b>listopt=format</b> shall be
the only or final <b>keyword=value</b> pair in a <b>-o</b> option-argument; all characters in the remainder of the option-argument
shall be considered part of the format string. When multiple <b>-o</b> <b>listopt=format</b> options are specified, the format
strings shall be considered a single, concatenated string, evaluated in command line order.</dd>

<dt><b>times</b></dt>

<dd>
(Applicable only to the <b>-x</b> <i>pax</i> format.) When used in <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, <i>pax</i> shall include
<b>atime</b> and <b>mtime</b> extended header records for each file. See <a href="#tag_20_92_13_05">pax Extended Header File
Times</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to these keywords, if the <b>-x</b> <i>pax</i> format is specified, any of the keywords and values defined in <a
href="#tag_20_92_13_03">pax Extended Header</a>, including implementation extensions, can be used in <b>-o</b> option-arguments,
in either of two modes:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>keyword</b>=<i>value</i></dt>

<dd>
When used in <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, these keyword/value pairs shall be included at the beginning of the archive as
<b>typeflag</b> <b>g</b> global extended header records. When used in <b>read</b> or <b>list</b> mode, these keyword/value pairs
shall act as if they had been at the beginning of the archive as <b>typeflag</b> <b>g</b> global extended header records.</dd>

<dt><b>keyword</b>:=<i>value</i></dt>

<dd>
When used in <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, these keyword/value pairs shall be included as records at the beginning of a
<b>typeflag</b> <b>x</b> extended header for each file. (This shall be equivalent to the &lt;equals-sign&gt; form except that it
creates no <b>typeflag</b> <b>g</b> global extended header records.) When used in <b>read</b> or <b>list</b> mode, these
keyword/value pairs shall act as if they were included as records at the end of each extended header; thus, they shall override any
global or file-specific extended header record keywords of the same names. For example, in the command:

for a file whose size is not 100 bytes), the behavior is undefined.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>-p&nbsp;</b> <i>string</i></dt>

<dd>Specify one or more file characteristic options (privileges). The <i>string</i> option-argument shall be a string specifying
file characteristics to be retained or discarded on extraction. The string shall consist of the specification characters <tt>a</tt>
, <tt>e</tt>, <tt>m</tt>, <tt>o</tt>, and <tt>p</tt>. Other implementation-defined characters can be included. Multiple
characteristics can be concatenated within the same string and multiple <b>-p</b> options can be specified. The meaning of the
specification characters are as follows: 

<dl compact>
<dt><tt>a</tt></dt>

<dd>Do not preserve file access times.</dd>

<dt><tt>e</tt></dt>

<dd>Preserve the user ID, group ID, file mode bits (see XBD <a href="../basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_169"><i>File Mode

<dd>Preserve the user ID and group ID.</dd>

<dt><tt>p</tt></dt>

<dd>Preserve the file mode bits. Other implementation-defined file mode attributes may be preserved.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In the preceding list, &quot;preserve&quot; indicates that an attribute stored in the archive shall be given to the extracted file,
subject to the permissions of the invoking process. The access and modification times of the file shall be preserved unless
otherwise specified with the <b>-p</b> option or not stored in the archive. All attributes that are not preserved shall be
determined as part of the normal file creation action (see <a href="../utilities/V3_chap01.html#tag_17_01_01_04"><i>File Read,
Write, and Creation</i></a>).</p>

<p>If neither the <tt>e</tt> nor the <tt>o</tt> specification character is specified, or the user ID and group ID are not preserved
for any reason, <i>pax</i> shall not set the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode.</p>

<p>If the preservation of any of these items fails for any reason, <i>pax</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error.
Failure to preserve these items shall affect the final exit status, but shall not cause the extracted file to be deleted.</p>

<p>If file characteristic letters in any of the <i>string</i> option-arguments are duplicated or conflict with each other, the ones
given last shall take precedence. For example, if <b>-p</b> <tt>eme</tt> is specified, file modification times are preserved.</p>

<dd>The sequence (<i>keyword</i>) can occur before a format conversion specifier. The conversion argument is defined by the value
of <i>keyword</i>. The implementation shall support the following keywords: 

<ul>
<li>
<p>Any of the Field Name entries in <a href="#tagtcjh_28">ustar Header Block</a> and <a href="#tagtcjh_29">Octet-Oriented cpio

<dt>8.</dt>

<dd>An additional conversion specifier character, <tt>T</tt>, shall be used to specify time formats. The <tt>T</tt> conversion
specifier character can be preceded by the sequence (<i>keyword=</i> <i>subformat</i>), where <i>subformat</i> is a date format as

<dt>10.</dt>

<dd>An additional conversion specifier character, <tt>D</tt>, shall be used to specify the device for block or special files, if

<p>A <i>pax</i> archive tape or file produced in the <b>-x</b> <b>pax</b> format shall contain a series of blocks. The physical
layout of the archive shall be identical to the <b>ustar</b> format described in <a href="#tag_20_92_13_06">ustar Interchange
Format</a>. Each file archived shall be represented by the following sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An optional header block with extended header records. This header block is of the form described in <a href=
"#tag_20_92_13_02">pax Header Block</a>, with a <i>typeflag</i> value of <b>x</b> or <b>g</b>. The extended header records,
described in <a href="#tag_20_92_13_03">pax Extended Header</a>, shall be included as the data for this header block.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A header block that describes the file. Any fields in the preceding optional extended header shall override the associated
fields in this header block for this file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Zero or more blocks that contain the contents of the file.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the archive file there shall be two 512-byte blocks filled with binary zeros, interpreted as an end-of-archive
indicator.</p>

<p>A schematic of an example archive with global extended header records and two actual files is shown in <a href="#tagfcjh_1">pax
Format Archive Example</a>. In the example, the second file in the archive has no extended header preceding it, presumably because
it has no need for extended attributes.</p>

</dl>

<center><b><a name="tagfcjh_1"></a> Figure: pax Format Archive Example</b></center>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_02"></a>pax Header Block</h5>

<p>The <b>pax</b> header block shall be identical to the <b>ustar</b> header block described in <a href="#tag_20_92_13_06">ustar
Interchange Format</a>, except that two additional <i>typeflag</i> values are defined:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><tt>x</tt></dt>

<dd>Represents extended header records for the following file in the archive (which shall have its own <b>ustar</b> header block).
The format of these extended header records shall be as described in <a href="#tag_20_92_13_03">pax Extended Header</a>.</dd>

<dt><tt>g</tt></dt>

<dd>Represents global extended header records for the following files in the archive. The format of these extended header records
shall be as described in <a href="#tag_20_92_13_03">pax Extended Header</a>. Each value shall affect all subsequent files that do
not override that value in their own extended header record and until another global extended header record is reached that
provides another value for the same field. The <i>typeflag</i> <b>g</b> global headers should not be used with interchange media
that could suffer partial data loss in transporting the archive.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For both of these types, the <i>size</i> field shall be the size of the extended header records in octets. The other fields in
the header block are not meaningful to this version of the <i>pax</i> utility. However, if this archive is read by a <i>pax</i>
utility conforming to the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard, the header block fields are used to create a regular file that contains
the extended header records as data. Therefore, header block field values should be selected to provide reasonable file access to
this regular file.</p>

<p>A further difference from the <b>ustar</b> header block is that data blocks for files of <i>typeflag</i> 1 (the digit one) (hard
link) may be included, which means that the size field may be greater than zero. Archives created by <i>pax</i> <b>-o</b>
<b>linkdata</b> shall include these data blocks with the hard links.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_03"></a>pax Extended Header</h5>

<p>A <b>pax</b> extended header contains values that are inappropriate for the <b>ustar</b> header block because of limitations in
that format: fields requiring a character encoding other than that described in the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard, fields
representing file attributes not described in the <b>ustar</b> header, and fields whose format or length do not fit the
requirements of the <b>ustar</b> header. The values in an extended header add attributes to the following file (or files; see the
description of the <i>typeflag</i> <b>g</b> header block) or override values in the following header block(s), as indicated in the
following list of keywords.</p>

<p>An extended header shall consist of one or more records, each constructed as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>"%d %s=%s\n", &lt;</tt><i>length</i><tt>&gt;, &lt;</tt><i>keyword</i><tt>&gt;, &lt;</tt><i>value</i><tt>&gt;
</tt>
</pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If <b>-o</b> <b>delete=keyword-prefix</b> is used, the affected attributes shall be determined from step 7., if applicable, or

</li>

<li>
<p>If <b>-o</b> <i>keyword</i>:= is used, the affected attributes shall be ignored.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <b>-o</b> <b>keyword:=value</b> is used, the affected attribute shall be assigned the value.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If there is a <i>typeflag</i> <b>x</b> extended header record, the affected attribute shall be assigned the
&lt;<i>value</i>&gt;. When extended header records conflict, the last one given in the header shall take precedence.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <b>-o</b> <b>keyword=value</b> is used, the affected attribute shall be assigned the value.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If there is a <i>typeflag</i> <b>g</b> global extended header record, the affected attribute shall be assigned the

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_05"></a>pax Extended Header File Times</h5>

<p>The <i>pax</i> utility shall write an <b>mtime</b> record for each file in <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> modes if the file's
modification time cannot be represented exactly in the <b>ustar</b> header logical record described in <a href=
"#tag_20_92_13_06">ustar Interchange Format</a>. This can occur if the time is out of <b>ustar</b> range, or if the file system of
the underlying implementation supports non-integer time granularities and the time is not an integer. All of these time records
shall be formatted as a decimal representation of the time in seconds since the Epoch. If a &lt;period&gt; ( <tt>'.'</tt> ) decimal
point character is present, the digits to the right of the point shall represent the units of a subsecond timing granularity, where
the first digit is tenths of a second and each subsequent digit is a tenth of the previous digit. In <b>read</b> or <b>copy</b>
mode, the <i>pax</i> utility shall truncate the time of a file to the greatest value that is not greater than the input header file
time. In <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> mode, the <i>pax</i> utility shall output a time exactly if it can be represented exactly as a
decimal number, and otherwise shall generate only enough digits so that the same time shall be recovered if the file is extracted
on a system whose underlying implementation supports the same time granularity.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_06"></a>ustar Interchange Format</h5>

<p>A <b>ustar</b> archive tape or file shall contain a series of logical records. Each logical record shall be a fixed-size logical
record of 512 octets (see below). Although this format may be thought of as being stored on 9-track industry-standard 12.7 mm (0.5
in) magnetic tape, other types of transportable media are not excluded. Each file archived shall be represented by a header logical
record that describes the file, followed by zero or more logical records that give the contents of the file. At the end of the
archive file there shall be two 512-octet logical records filled with binary zeros, interpreted as an end-of-archive indicator.</p>

<p>The logical records may be grouped for physical I/O operations, as described under the <b>-b</b> <i>blocksize</i> and <b>-x</b>
<b>ustar</b> options. Each group of logical records may be written with a single operation equivalent to the <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> function. On magnetic tape, the result of this write shall be a single tape physical
block. The last physical block shall always be the full size, so logical records after the two zero logical records may contain
undefined data.</p>

<p>The header logical record shall be structured as shown in the following table. All lengths and offsets are in decimal.<br>

<p>All characters in the header logical record shall be represented in the coded character set of the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991
standard. For maximum portability between implementations, names should be selected from characters represented by the portable
filename character set as octets with the most significant bit zero. If an implementation supports the use of characters outside of
&lt;slash&gt; and the portable filename character set in names for files, users, and groups, one or more implementation-defined
encodings of these characters shall be provided for interchange purposes.</p>

<p>However, the <i>pax</i> utility shall never create filenames on the local system that cannot be accessed via the procedures
described in POSIX.1-2017. If a filename is found on the medium that would create an invalid filename, it is implementation-defined
whether the data from the file is stored on the file hierarchy and under what name it is stored. The <i>pax</i> utility may choose
to ignore these files as long as it produces an error indicating that the file is being ignored.</p>

<p>Each field within the header logical record is contiguous; that is, there is no padding used. Each character on the archive
medium shall be stored contiguously.</p>

<p>The fields <i>magic</i>, <i>uname</i>, and <i>gname</i> are character strings each terminated by a NUL character. The fields
<i>name</i>, <i>linkname</i>, and <i>prefix</i> are NUL-terminated character strings except when all characters in the array
contain non-NUL characters including the last character. The <i>version</i> field is two octets containing the characters
<tt>"00"</tt> (zero-zero). The <i>typeflag</i> contains a single character. All other fields are leading zero-filled octal numbers
using digits from the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard IRV. Each numeric field is terminated by one or more &lt;space&gt; or NUL
characters.</p>

<p>The <i>name</i> and the <i>prefix</i> fields shall produce the pathname of the file. A new pathname shall be formed, if
<i>prefix</i> is not an empty string (its first character is not NUL), by concatenating <i>prefix</i> (up to the first NUL
character), a &lt;slash&gt; character, and <i>name</i>; otherwise, <i>name</i> is used alone. In either case, <i>name</i> is
terminated at the first NUL character. If <i>prefix</i> begins with a NUL character, it shall be ignored. In this manner, pathnames
of at most 256 characters can be supported. If a pathname does not fit in the space provided, <i>pax</i> shall notify the user of
the error, and shall not store any part of the file-header or data-on the medium.</p>

<p>The <i>linkname</i> field, described below, shall not use the <i>prefix</i> to produce a pathname. As such, a <i>linkname</i> is
limited to 100 characters. If the name does not fit in the space provided, <i>pax</i> shall notify the user of the error, and shall
not attempt to store the link on the medium.</p>

<p>The <i>mode</i> field provides 12 bits encoded in the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard octal digit representation. The encoded
bits shall represent the following values:<br>

<p>When appropriate privileges are required to set one of these mode bits, and the user restoring the files from the archive does
not have appropriate privileges, the mode bits for which the user does not have appropriate privileges shall be ignored. Some of
the mode bits in the archive format are not mentioned elsewhere in this volume of POSIX.1-2017. If the implementation does not
support those bits, they may be ignored.</p>

<p>The <i>uid</i> and <i>gid</i> fields are the user and group ID of the owner and group of the file, respectively.</p>

<p>The <i>size</i> field is the size of the file in octets. If the <i>typeflag</i> field is set to specify a file to be of type 1
(a link) or 2 (a symbolic link), the <i>size</i> field shall be specified as zero. If the <i>typeflag</i> field is set to specify a
file of type 5 (directory), the <i>size</i> field shall be interpreted as described under the definition of that record type. No
data logical records are stored for types 1, 2, or 5. If the <i>typeflag</i> field is set to 3 (character special file), 4 (block
special file), or 6 (FIFO), the meaning of the <i>size</i> field is unspecified by this volume of POSIX.1-2017, and no data logical
records shall be stored on the medium. Additionally, for type 6, the <i>size</i> field shall be ignored when reading. If the
<i>typeflag</i> field is set to any other value, the number of logical records written following the header shall be (
<i>size</i>+511)/512, ignoring any fraction in the result of the division.</p>

<p>The <i>mtime</i> field shall be the modification time of the file at the time it was archived. It is the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991
standard representation of the octal value of the modification time obtained from the <a href=
"../functions/stat.html"><i>stat</i>()</a> function.</p>

<p>The <i>chksum</i> field shall be the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard IRV representation of the octal value of the simple sum of
all octets in the header logical record. Each octet in the header shall be treated as an unsigned value. These values shall be
added to an unsigned integer, initialized to zero, the precision of which is not less than 17 bits. When calculating the checksum,
the <i>chksum</i> field is treated as if it were all &lt;space&gt; characters.</p>

<p>The <i>typeflag</i> field specifies the type of file archived. If a particular implementation does not recognize the type, or
the user does not have appropriate privileges to create that type, the file shall be extracted as if it were a regular file if the
file type is defined to have a meaning for the <i>size</i> field that could cause data logical records to be written on the medium
(see the previous description for <i>size</i>). If conversion to a regular file occurs, the <i>pax</i> utility shall produce an
error indicating that the conversion took place. All of the <i>typeflag</i> fields shall be coded in the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991
standard IRV:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><tt>0</tt></dt>

<dd>Represents a regular file. For backwards-compatibility, a <i>typeflag</i> value of binary zero ( <tt>'\0'</tt> ) should be
recognized as meaning a regular file when extracting files from the archive. Archives written with this version of the archive file
format create regular files with a <i>typeflag</i> value of the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard IRV <tt>'0'</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>1</tt></dt>

<dd>Represents a file linked to another file, of any type, previously archived. Such files are identified by having the same device
and file serial numbers, and pathnames that refer to different directory entries. All such files shall be archived as linked files.
The linked-to name is specified in the <i>linkname</i> field with a NUL-character terminator if it is less than 100 octets in
length.</dd>

<dt><tt>2</tt></dt>

<dd>Represents a symbolic link. The contents of the symbolic link shall be stored in the <i>linkname</i> field.</dd>

<dt><tt>3,4</tt></dt>

<dd>Represent character special files and block special files respectively. In this case the <i>devmajor</i> and <i>devminor</i>
fields shall contain information defining the device, the format of which is unspecified by this volume of POSIX.1-2017.
Implementations may map the device specifications to their own local specification or may ignore the entry.</dd>

<dt><tt>5</tt></dt>

<dd>Specifies a directory or subdirectory. On systems where disk allocation is performed on a directory basis, the <i>size</i>
field shall contain the maximum number of octets (which may be rounded to the nearest disk block allocation unit) that the
directory may hold. A <i>size</i> field of zero indicates no such limiting. Systems that do not support limiting in this manner
should ignore the <i>size</i> field.</dd>

<dt><tt>6</tt></dt>

<dd>Specifies a FIFO special file. Note that the archiving of a FIFO file archives the existence of this file and not its
contents.</dd>

<dt><tt>7</tt></dt>

<dd>Reserved to represent a file to which an implementation has associated some high-performance attribute. Implementations without
such extensions should treat this file as a regular file (type 0).</dd>

<dt><tt>A-Z</tt></dt>

<dd>The letters <tt>'A'</tt> to <tt>'Z'</tt>, inclusive, are reserved for custom implementations. All other values are reserved
for future versions of this standard.</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is unspecified whether files with pathnames that refer to the same directory entry are archived as linked files or as
separate files. If they are archived as linked files, this means that attempting to extract both pathnames from the resulting
archive will always cause an error (unless the <b>-u</b> option is used) because the link cannot be created.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether files with the same device and file serial numbers being appended to an archive are treated as linked
files to members that were in the archive before the append.</p>

<p>Attempts to archive a socket shall produce a diagnostic message when <b>ustar</b> interchange format is used, but may be allowed
when <b>pax</b> interchange format is used. Handling of other file types is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The <i>magic</i> field is the specification that this archive was output in this archive format. If this field contains
<b>ustar</b> (the five characters from the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard IRV shown followed by NUL), the <i>uname</i> and
<i>gname</i> fields shall contain the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard IRV representation of the owner and group of the file,
respectively (truncated to fit, if necessary). When the file is restored by a privileged, protection-preserving version of the
utility, the user and group databases shall be scanned for these names. If found, the user and group IDs contained within these
files shall be used rather than the values contained within the <i>uid</i> and <i>gid</i> fields.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_07"></a>cpio Interchange Format</h5>

<p>The octet-oriented <b>cpio</b> archive format shall be a series of entries, each comprising a header that describes the file,
the name of the file, and then the contents of the file.</p>

<p>An archive may be recorded as a series of fixed-size blocks of octets. This blocking shall be used only to make physical I/O
more efficient. The last group of blocks shall always be at the full size.</p>

<p>For the octet-oriented <b>cpio</b> archive format, the individual entry information shall be in the order indicated and
described by the following table; see also the <a href="../basedefs/cpio.h.html"><i>&lt;cpio.h&gt;</i></a> header.<br>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_08"></a>cpio Header</h5>

<p>For each file in the archive, a header as defined previously shall be written. The information in the header fields is written
as streams of the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard characters interpreted as octal numbers. The octal numbers shall be extended to

<p>If a filename is found on the medium that would create an invalid pathname, it is implementation-defined whether the data from
the file is stored on the file hierarchy and under what name it is stored.</p>

<p>All characters shall be represented in the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard IRV. For maximum portability between implementations,
names should be selected from characters represented by the portable filename character set as octets with the most significant bit
zero. If an implementation supports the use of characters outside the portable filename character set in names for files, users,
and groups, one or more implementation-defined encodings of these characters shall be provided for interchange purposes. However,
the <i>pax</i> utility shall never create filenames on the local system that cannot be accessed via the procedures described
previously in this volume of POSIX.1-2017. If a filename is found on the medium that would create an invalid filename, it is
implementation-defined whether the data from the file is stored on the local file system and under what name it is stored. The
<i>pax</i> utility may choose to ignore these files as long as it produces an error indicating that the file is being ignored.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_10"></a>cpio File Data</h5>

<p>Following <i>c_name</i>, there shall be <i>c_filesize</i> octets of data. Interpretation of such data occurs in a manner
dependent on the file. For regular files, the data shall consist of the contents of the file. For symbolic links, the data shall
consist of the contents of the symbolic link. If <i>c_filesize</i> is zero, no data shall be contained in <i>c_filedata</i>.</p>

<p>When restoring from an archive:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the user does not have appropriate privileges to create a file of the specified type, <i>pax</i> shall ignore the entry and
write an error message to standard error.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Only regular files and symbolic links have data to be restored. Presuming a regular file meets any selection criteria that might
be imposed on the format-reading utility by the user, such data shall be restored.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If a user does not have appropriate privileges to set a particular mode flag, the flag shall be ignored. Some of the mode flags
in the archive format are not mentioned elsewhere in this volume of POSIX.1-2017. If the implementation does not support those
flags, they may be ignored.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_13_11"></a>cpio Special Entries</h5>

<p>FIFO special files, directories, and the trailer shall be recorded with <i>c_filesize</i> equal to zero. Symbolic links shall be

<i>c_filesize</i> is unspecified by this volume of POSIX.1-2017. The header for the next file entry in the archive shall be written
directly after the last octet of the file entry preceding it. A header denoting the filename <b>TRAILER!!!</b> shall indicate the
end of the archive; the contents of octets in the last block of the archive following such a header are undefined.</p>

<p>If <i>pax</i> cannot create a file or a link when reading an archive or cannot find a file when writing an archive, or cannot

<p>If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, <i>pax</i> may have only partially
extracted the file or (if the <b>-n</b> option was not specified) may have extracted a file of the same name as that specified by

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_92_16"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Caution is advised when using the <b>-a</b> option to append to a <i>cpio</i> format archive. If any of the files being appended
happen to be given the same <i>c_dev</i> and <i>c_ino</i> values as a file in the existing part of the archive, then they may be
treated as links to that file on extraction. Thus, it is risky to use <b>-a</b> with <i>cpio</i> format except when it is done on
the same system that the original archive was created on, and with the same <i>pax</i> utility, and in the knowledge that there has
been little or no file system activity since the original archive was created that could lead to any of the files appended being
given the same <i>c_dev</i> and <i>c_ino</i> values as an unrelated file in the existing part of the archive. Also, when
(intentionally) appending additional links to a file in the existing part of the archive, the <i>c_nlink</i> values in the modified
archive can be smaller than the number of links to the file in the archive, which may mean that the links are not preserved on
extraction.</p>

<p>The <b>-p</b> (privileges) option was invented to reconcile differences between historical <i>tar</i> and <i>cpio</i>
implementations. In particular, the two utilities use <b>-m</b> in diametrically opposed ways. The <b>-p</b> option also provides a
consistent means of extending the ways in which future file attributes can be addressed, such as for enhanced security systems or
high-performance files. Although it may seem complex, there are really two modes that are most commonly used:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>-p&nbsp;e</b></dt>

<dd>``Preserve everything&quot;. This would be used by the historical superuser, someone with all appropriate privileges, to preserve
all aspects of the files as they are recorded in the archive. The <b>e</b> flag is the sum of <b>o</b> and <b>p</b>, and other
implementation-defined attributes.</dd>

<dt><b>-p&nbsp;p</b></dt>

<dd>``Preserve&quot; the file mode bits. This would be used by the user with regular privileges who wished to preserve aspects of the
file other than the ownership. The file times are preserved by default, but two other flags are offered to disable these and use
the time of extraction.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The one pathname per line format of standard input precludes pathnames containing &lt;newline&gt; characters. Although such
pathnames violate the portable filename guidelines, they may exist and their presence may inhibit usage of <i>pax</i> within shell
scripts. This problem is inherited from historical archive programs. The problem can be avoided by listing filename arguments on
the command line instead of on standard input.</p>

<p>It is almost certain that appropriate privileges are required for <i>pax</i> to accomplish parts of this volume of POSIX.1-2017.
Specifically, creating files of type block special or character special, restoring file access times unless the files are owned by
the user (the <b>-t</b> option), or preserving file owner, group, and mode (the <b>-p</b> option) all probably require appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>In <b>read</b> mode, implementations are permitted to overwrite files when the archive has multiple members with the same name.
This may fail if permissions on the first version of the file do not permit it to be overwritten.</p>

<p>The <b>cpio</b> and <b>ustar</b> formats can only support files up to 8589934592 bytes (8 * 2^30) in size.</p>

<p>When archives containing binary header information are listed , the filenames printed may cause strange behavior on some
terminals.</p>

<p>When all of the following are true:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A file of type directory is being placed into an archive.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <b>ustar</b> archive format is being used.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The pathname of the directory is less than or equal to 155 bytes long (it will fit in the <i>prefix</i> field in the
<b>ustar</b> header block).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The last component of the pathname of the directory is longer than 100 bytes long (it will not fit in the <i>name</i> field in
the <b>ustar</b> header block).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>some implementations of the <i>pax</i> utility will place the entire directory pathname in the <i>prefix</i> field, set the
<i>name</i> field to an empty string, and place the directory in the archive. Other implementations of the <i>pax</i> utility will
give an error under these conditions because the <i>name</i> field is not large enough to hold the last component of the directory
name. This standard allows either behavior. However, when extracting a directory from a <b>ustar</b> format archive, this standard
requires that all implementations be able to extract a directory even if the <i>name</i> field contains an empty string as long as
the <i>prefix</i> field does not also contain an empty string.</p>

<h4 class="mansect"><a name="tag_20_92_18"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>pax</i> utility was new for the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard. It represents a peaceful compromise between advocates of
the historical <i>tar</i> and <i>cpio</i> utilities.</p>

<p>A fundamental difference between <i>cpio</i> and <i>tar</i> was in the way directories were treated. The <i>cpio</i> utility did
not treat directories differently from other files, and to select a directory and its contents required that each file in the
hierarchy be explicitly specified. For <i>tar</i>, a directory matched every file in the file hierarchy it rooted.</p>

<p>The <i>pax</i> utility offers both interfaces; by default, directories map into the file hierarchy they root. The <b>-d</b>
option causes <i>pax</i> to skip any file not explicitly referenced, as <i>cpio</i> historically did. The <i>tar</i> <b>-</b>
<i>style</i> behavior was chosen as the default because it was believed that this was the more common usage and because <i>tar</i>
is the more commonly available interface, as it was historically provided on both System V and BSD implementations.</p>

<p>The data interchange format specification in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 requires that processes with &quot;appropriate privileges''
shall always restore the ownership and permissions of extracted files exactly as archived. If viewed from the historic equivalence
between superuser and &quot;appropriate privileges&quot;, there are two problems with this requirement. First, users running as superusers
may unknowingly set dangerous permissions on extracted files. Second, it is needlessly limiting, in that superusers cannot extract
files and own them as superuser unless the archive was created by the superuser. (It should be noted that restoration of ownerships
and permissions for the superuser, by default, is historical practice in <i>cpio</i>, but not in <i>tar</i>.) In order to avoid
these two problems, the <i>pax</i> specification has an additional &quot;privilege&quot; mechanism, the <b>-p</b> option. Only a <i>pax</i>
invocation with the privileges needed, and which has the <b>-p</b> option set using the <tt>e</tt> specification character, has
appropriate privileges to restore full ownership and permission information.</p>

<p>Note also that this volume of POSIX.1-2017 requires that the file ownership and access permissions shall be set, on extraction,
in the same fashion as the <a href="../functions/creat.html"><i>creat</i>()</a> function when provided with the mode stored in the
archive. This means that the file creation mask of the user is applied to the file permissions.</p>

<p>Users should note that directories may be created by <i>pax</i> while extracting files with permissions that are different from
those that existed at the time the archive was created. When extracting sensitive information into a directory hierarchy that no
longer exists, users are encouraged to set their file creation mask appropriately to protect these files during extraction.</p>

<p>The table of contents output is written to standard output to facilitate pipeline processing.</p>

<p>An early proposal had hard links displaying for all pathnames. This was removed because it complicates the output of the case
where <b>-v</b> is not specified and does not match historical <i>cpio</i> usage. The hard-link information is available in the
<b>-v</b> display.</p>

<p>The description of the <b>-l</b> option allows implementations to make hard links to symbolic links. Earlier versions of this
standard did not specify any way to create a hard link to a symbolic link, but many implementations provided this capability as an
extension. If there are hard links to symbolic links when an archive is created, the implementation is required to archive the hard
link in the archive (unless <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> is specified). When in <b>read</b> mode and in <b>copy</b> mode, implementations
supporting hard links to symbolic links should use them when appropriate.</p>

<p>The archive formats inherited from the POSIX.1-1990 standard have certain restrictions that have been brought along from
historical usage. For example, there are restrictions on the length of pathnames stored in the archive. When <i>pax</i> is used in
<b>copy</b>(<b>-rw</b>) mode (copying directory hierarchies), the ability to use extensions from the <b>-x</b> <b>pax</b> format
overcomes these restrictions.</p>

<p>The default <i>blocksize</i> value of 5120 bytes for <i>cpio</i> was selected because it is one of the standard block-size
values for <i>cpio</i>, set when the <b>-B</b> option is specified. (The other default block-size value for <i>cpio</i> is 512
bytes, and this was considered to be too small.) The default block value of 10240 bytes for <i>tar</i> was selected because that is
the standard block-size value for BSD <i>tar</i>. The maximum block size of 32256 bytes (2<small><sup>15</sup></small>-512 bytes)
is the largest multiple of 512 bytes that fits into a signed 16-bit tape controller transfer register. There are known limitations
in some historical systems that would prevent larger blocks from being accepted. Historical values were chosen to improve
compatibility with historical scripts using <a href="../utilities/dd.html"><i>dd</i></a> or similar utilities to manipulate
archives. Also, default block sizes for any file type other than character special file has been deleted from this volume of
POSIX.1-2017 as unimportant and not likely to affect the structure of the resulting archive.</p>

<p>Implementations are permitted to modify the block-size value based on the archive format or the device to which the archive is
being written. This is to provide implementations with the opportunity to take advantage of special types of devices, and it should
not be used without a great deal of consideration as it almost certainly decreases archive portability.</p>

<p>The intended use of the <b>-n</b> option was to permit extraction of one or more files from the archive without processing the
entire archive. This was viewed by the standard developers as offering significant performance advantages over historical
implementations. The <b>-n</b> option in early proposals had three effects; the first was to cause special characters in patterns
to not be treated specially. The second was to cause only the first file that matched a pattern to be extracted. The third was to
cause <i>pax</i> to write a diagnostic message to standard error when no file was found matching a specified pattern. Only the
second behavior is retained by this volume of POSIX.1-2017, for many reasons. First, it is in general not acceptable for a single
option to have multiple effects. Second, the ability to make pattern matching characters act as normal characters is useful for
parts of <i>pax</i> other than file extraction. Third, a finer degree of control over the special characters is useful because
users may wish to normalize only a single special character in a single filename. Fourth, given a more general escape mechanism,
the previous behavior of the <b>-n</b> option can be easily obtained using the <b>-s</b> option or a <a href=
"../utilities/sed.html"><i>sed</i></a> script. Finally, writing a diagnostic message when a pattern specified by the user is
unmatched by any file is useful behavior in all cases.</p>

<p>In this version, the <b>-n</b> was removed from the <b>copy</b> mode synopsis of <i>pax</i>; it is inapplicable because there
are no pattern operands specified in this mode.</p>

<p>There is another method than <i>pax</i> for copying subtrees in POSIX.1-2017 described as part of the <a href=
"../utilities/cp.html"><i>cp</i></a> utility. Both methods are historical practice: <a href="../utilities/cp.html"><i>cp</i></a>
provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, while <i>pax</i> offers a finer granularity of control. Each provides additional
functionality to the other; in particular, <i>pax</i> maintains the hard-link structure of the hierarchy while <a href=
"../utilities/cp.html"><i>cp</i></a> does not. It is the intention of the standard developers that the results be similar (using
appropriate option combinations in both utilities). The results are not required to be identical; there seemed insufficient gain to
applications to balance the difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that the results would be exactly identical.</p>

<p>A single archive may span more than one file. It is suggested that implementations provide informative messages to the user on
standard error whenever the archive file is changed.</p>

<p>The <b>-d</b> option (do not create intermediate directories not listed in the archive) found in early proposals was originally
provided as a complement to the historic <b>-d</b> option of <i>cpio</i>. It has been deleted.</p>

<p>The <b>-s</b> option in early proposals specified a subset of the substitution command from the <a href=
"../utilities/ed.html"><i>ed</i></a> utility. As there was no reason for only a subset to be supported, the <b>-s</b> option is now
compatible with the current <a href="../utilities/ed.html"><i>ed</i></a> specification. Since the delimiter can be any non-null
character, the following usage with single &lt;space&gt; characters is valid:</p>

<pre>
<tt>pax -s " foo bar " ...
</tt>
</pre>

<p>The <b>-t</b> description is worded so as to note that this may cause the access time update caused by some other activity
(which occurs while the file is being read) to be overwritten.</p>

<p>The default behavior of <i>pax</i> with regard to file modification times is the same as historical implementations of
<i>tar</i>. It is not the historical behavior of <i>cpio</i>.</p>

<p>Because the <b>-i</b> option uses <b>/dev/tty</b>, utilities without a controlling terminal are not able to use this option.</p>

<p>The <b>-y</b> option, found in early proposals, has been deleted because a line containing a single &lt;period&gt; for the
<b>-i</b> option has equivalent functionality. The special lines for the <b>-i</b> option (a single &lt;period&gt; and the empty
line) are historical practice in <i>cpio</i>.</p>

<p>In early drafts, a <b>-e</b> <i>charmap</i> option was included to increase portability of files between systems using different
coded character sets. This option was omitted because it was apparent that consensus could not be formed for it. In this version,
the use of UTF-8 should be an adequate substitute.</p>

<p>The ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard and ISO&nbsp;POSIX-1 standard requirements for <i>pax</i>, however, made it very difficult to
create a single archive containing files created using extended characters provided by different locales. This version adds the
<b>hdrcharset</b> keyword to make it possible to archive files in these cases without dropping files due to translation errors.</p>

<p>Translating filenames and other attributes from a locale's encoding to UTF-8 and then back again can lose information, as the
resulting filename might not be byte-for-byte equivalent to the original. To avoid this problem, users can specify the <b>-o</b>
<b>hdrcharset=binary</b> option, which will cause the resulting archive to use binary format for all names and attributes. Such
archives are not portable among hosts that use different native encodings (e.g., EBCDIC <i>versus</i> ASCII-based encodings), but
they will allow interchange among the vast majority of POSIX file systems in practical use. Also, the <b>-o</b>
<b>hdrcharset=binary</b> option will cause <i>pax</i> in <b>copy</b> mode to behave more like other standard utilities such as <a
href="../utilities/cp.html"><i>cp</i></a>.</p>

<p>If the values specified by the <b>-o</b> <b>exthdr.name=value</b>, <b>-o</b> <b>globexthdr.name=value</b>, or by <b>$TMPDIR</b>
(if <b>-o</b> <b>globexthdr.name</b> is not specified) require a character encoding other than that described in the
ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard, a <b>path</b> extended header record will have to be created for the file. If a <b>hdrcharset</b>
extended header record is active for such headers, it will determine the codeset used for the value field in these extended
<b>path</b> header records. These <b>path</b> extended header records always need to be created when writing an archive even if
<b>hdrcharset=binary</b> has been specified and would contain the same (binary) data that appears in the <b>ustar</b> header record
prefix and <i>name</i> fields. (In other words, an extended header <b>path</b> record is always required to be generated if the
<i>prefix</i> or <i>name</i> fields contain non-ASCII characters even when <b>hdrcharset=binary</b> is also in effect for that
file.)</p>

<p>The <b>-k</b> option was added to address international concerns about the dangers involved in the character set transformations
of <b>-e</b> (if the target character set were different from the source, the filenames might be transformed into names matching
existing files) and also was made more general to protect files transferred between file systems with different {NAME_MAX} values
(truncating a filename on a smaller system might also inadvertently overwrite existing files). As stated, it prevents any
overwriting, even if the target file is older than the source. This version adds more granularity of options to solve this problem
by introducing the <b>-o</b> <b>invalid=option</b> -specifically the <b>UTF-8</b> and <b>binary</b> actions. (Note that an existing
file is still subject to overwriting in this case. The <b>-k</b> option closes that loophole.)</p>

<p>Some of the file characteristics referenced in this volume of POSIX.1-2017 might not be supported by some archive formats. For
example, neither the <b>tar</b> nor <b>cpio</b> formats contain the file access time. For this reason, the <tt>e</tt> specification
character has been provided, intended to cause all file characteristics specified in the archive to be retained.</p>

<p>It is required that extracted directories, by default, have their access and modification times and permissions set to the
values specified in the archive. This has obvious problems in that the directories are almost certainly modified after being
extracted and that directory permissions may not permit file creation. One possible solution is to create directories with the mode
specified in the archive, as modified by the <a href="../utilities/umask.html"><i>umask</i></a> of the user, with sufficient
permissions to allow file creation. After all files have been extracted, <i>pax</i> would then reset the access and modification
times and permissions as necessary.</p>

<p>The list-mode formatting description borrows heavily from the one defined by the <a href=
"../utilities/printf.html"><i>printf</i></a> utility. However, since there is no separate operand list to get conversion arguments,
the format was extended to allow specifying the name of the conversion argument as part of the conversion specification.</p>

<p>The <tt>T</tt> conversion specifier allows time fields to be displayed in any of the date formats. Unlike the <a href=
"../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> utility, <i>pax</i> does not adjust the format when the date is less than six months in the
past. This makes parsing the output more predictable.</p>

<p>The <tt>D</tt> conversion specifier handles the ability to display the major/minor or file size, as with <a href=
"../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a>, by using <tt>%-8(</tt><i>size</i><tt>)D</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>L</tt> conversion specifier handles the <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> display for symbolic links.</p>

<p>Conversion specifiers were added to generate existing known types used for <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_18_01"></a>pax Interchange Format</h5>

<p>The new POSIX data interchange format was developed primarily to satisfy international concerns that the <b>ustar</b> and
<b>cpio</b> formats did not provide for file, user, and group names encoded in characters outside a subset of the
ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard. The standard developers realized that this new POSIX data interchange format should be very
extensible because there were other requirements they foresaw in the near future:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Support international character encodings and locale information</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Support security information (ACLs, and so on)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Support future file types, such as realtime or contiguous files</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Include data areas for implementation use</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Support systems with words larger than 32 bits and timers with subsecond granularity</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following were not goals for this format because these are better handled by separate utilities or are inappropriate for a
portable format:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Encryption</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Compression</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Data translation between locales and codesets</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><i>inode</i> storage</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The format chosen to support the goals is an extension of the <b>ustar</b> format. Of the two formats previously available, only
the <b>ustar</b> format was selected for extensions because:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It was easier to extend in an upwards-compatible way. It offered version flags and header block type fields with room for future
standardization. The <b>cpio</b> format, while possessing a more flexible file naming methodology, could not be extended without
breaking some theoretical implementation or using a dummy filename that could be a legitimate filename.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Industry experience since the original &quot; <i>tar</i> wars&quot; fought in developing the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-1 standard has clearly been
in favor of the <b>ustar</b> format, which is generally the default output format selected for <i>pax</i> implementations on new
systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The new format was designed with one additional goal in mind: reasonable behavior when an older <i>tar</i> or <i>pax</i> utility
happened to read an archive. Since the POSIX.1-1990 standard mandated that a &quot;format-reading utility&quot; had to treat unrecognized
<i>typeflag</i> values as regular files, this allowed the format to include all the extended information in a pseudo-regular file
that preceded each real file. An option is given that allows the archive creator to set up reasonable names for these files on the
older systems. Also, the normative text suggests that reasonable file access values be used for this <b>ustar</b> header block.
Making these header files inaccessible for convenient reading and deleting would not be reasonable. File permissions of 600 or 700
are suggested.</p>

<p>The <b>ustar</b> <i>typeflag</i> field was used to accommodate the additional functionality of the new format rather than magic
or version because the POSIX.1-1990 standard (and, by reference, the previous version of <i>pax</i>), mandated the behavior of the
format-reading utility when it encountered an unknown <i>typeflag</i>, but was silent about the other two fields.</p>

<p>Early proposals for the first version of this standard contained a proposed archive format that was based on compatibility with
the standard for tape files (ISO&nbsp;1001, similar to the format used historically on many mainframes and minicomputers). This
format was overly complex and required considerable overhead in volume and header records. Furthermore, the standard developers
felt that it would not be acceptable to the community of POSIX developers, so it was later changed to be a format more closely
related to historical practice on POSIX systems.</p>

<p>The prefix and name split of pathnames in <b>ustar</b> was replaced by the single path extended header record for
simplicity.</p>

<p>The concept of a global extended header (<i>typeflag</i> <b>g</b>) was controversial. If this were applied to an archive being
recorded on magnetic tape, a few unreadable blocks at the beginning of the tape could be a serious problem; a utility attempting to
extract as many files as possible from a damaged archive could lose a large percentage of file header information in this case.
However, if the archive were on a reliable medium, such as a CD-ROM, the global extended header offers considerable potential size
reductions by eliminating redundant information. Thus, the text warns against using the global method for unreliable media and
provides a method for implanting global information in the extended header for each file, rather than in the <i>typeflag</i>
<b>g</b> records.</p>

<p>No facility for data translation or filtering on a per-file basis is included because the standard developers could not invent
an interface that would allow this in an efficient manner. If a filter, such as encryption or compression, is to be applied to all
the files, it is more efficient to apply the filter to the entire archive as a single file. The standard developers considered
interfaces that would invoke a shell script for each file going into or out of the archive, but the system overhead in this
approach was considered to be too high.</p>

<p>One such approach would be to have <b>filter=</b> records that give a pathname for an executable. When the program is invoked,
the file and archive would be open for standard input/output and all the header fields would be available as environment variables
or command-line arguments. The standard developers did discuss such schemes, but they were omitted from POSIX.1-2017 due to
concerns about excessive overhead. Also, the program itself would need to be in the archive if it were to be used portably.</p>

<p>There is currently no portable means of identifying the character set(s) used for a file in the file system. Therefore,
<i>pax</i> has not been given a mechanism to generate charset records automatically. The only portable means of doing this is for
the user to write the archive using the <b>-o</b> <b>charset=string</b> command line option. This assumes that all of the files in
the archive use the same encoding. The &quot;implementation-defined&quot; text is included to allow for a system that can identify the
encodings used for each of its files.</p>

<p>The table of standards that accompanies the charset record description is acknowledged to be very limited. Only a limited number
of character set standards is reasonable for maximal interchange. Any character set is, of course, possible by prior agreement. It
was suggested that EBCDIC be listed, but it was omitted because it is not defined by a formal standard. Formal standards, and then
only those with reasonably large followings, can be included here, simply as a matter of practicality. The &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;s
represent names of officially registered character sets in the format required by the ISO&nbsp;2375:1985 standard.</p>

<p>The normal &lt;comma&gt; or &lt;blank&gt;-separated list rules are not followed in the case of keyword options to allow ease of
argument parsing for <a href="../utilities/getopts.html"><i>getopts</i></a>.</p>

<p>Further information on character encodings is in <a href="#tag_20_92_18_02">pax Archive Character Set Encoding/Decoding</a>
.</p>

<p>The standard developers have reserved keyword name space for vendor extensions. It is suggested that the format to be used
is:</p>

<pre>
<i>VENDOR.keyword</i>
</pre>

<p>where <i>VENDOR</i> is the name of the vendor or organization in all uppercase letters. It is further suggested that the keyword
following the &lt;period&gt; be named differently than any of the standard keywords so that it could be used for future
standardization, if appropriate, by omitting the <i>VENDOR</i> prefix.</p>

<p>The &lt;<i>length</i>&gt; field in the extended header record was included to make it simpler to step through the records, even
if a record contains an unknown format (to a particular <i>pax</i>) with complex interactions of special characters. It also
provides a minor integrity checkpoint within the records to aid a program attempting to recover files from a damaged archive.</p>

<p>There are no extended header versions of the <i>devmajor</i> and <i>devminor</i> fields because the unspecified format
<b>ustar</b> header field should be sufficient. If they are not, vendor-specific extended keywords (such as <i>VENDOR.devmajor</i>)
should be used.</p>

<p>Device and <i>i</i>-number labeling of files was not adopted from <i>cpio</i>; files are interchanged strictly on a symbolic
name basis, as in <b>ustar</b>.</p>

<p>Just as with the <b>ustar</b> format descriptions, the new format makes no special arrangements for multi-volume archives. Each
of the <i>pax</i> archive types is assumed to be inside a single POSIX file and splitting that file over multiple volumes
(diskettes, tape cartridges, and so on), processing their labels, and mounting each in the proper sequence are considered to be
implementation details that cannot be described portably.</p>

<p>The <b>pax</b> format is intended for interchange, not only for backup on a single (family of) systems. It is not as densely
packed as might be possible for backup:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It contains information as coded characters that could be coded in binary.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It identifies extended records with name fields that could be omitted in favor of a fixed-field layout.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It translates names into a portable character set and identifies locale-related information, both of which are probably
unnecessary for backup.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements on restoring from an archive are slightly different from the historical wording, allowing for non-monolithic
privilege to bring forward as much as possible. In particular, attributes such as &quot;high performance file&quot; might be broadly but
not universally granted while set-user-ID or <a href="../functions/chown.html"><i>chown</i>()</a> might be much more restricted.
There is no implication in POSIX.1-2017 that the security information be honored after it is restored to the file hierarchy, in
spite of what might be improperly inferred by the silence on that topic. That is a topic for another standard.</p>

<p>Links are recorded in the fashion described here because a link can be to any file type. It is desirable in general to be able
to restore part of an archive selectively and restore all of those files completely. If the data is not associated with each link,
it is not possible to do this. However, the data associated with a file can be large, and when selective restoration is not needed,
this can be a significant burden. The archive is structured so that files that have no associated data can always be restored by
the name of any link name of any link, and the user may choose whether data is recorded with each instance of a file that contains
data. The format permits mixing of both types of links in a single archive; this can be done for special needs, and <i>pax</i> is
expected to interpret such archives on input properly, despite the fact that there is no <i>pax</i> option that would force this
mixed case on output. (When <b>-o</b> <b>linkdata</b> is used, the output must contain the duplicate data, but the implementation
is free to include it or omit it when <b>-o</b> <b>linkdata</b> is not used.)</p>

<p>The time values are included as extended header records for those implementations needing more than the eleven octal digits
allowed by the <b>ustar</b> format. Portable file timestamps cannot be negative. If <i>pax</i> encounters a file with a negative
timestamp in <b>copy</b> or <b>write</b> mode, it can reject the file, substitute a non-negative timestamp, or generate a
non-portable timestamp with a leading <tt>'-'</tt>. Even though some implementations can support finer file-time granularities
than seconds, the normative text requires support only for seconds since the Epoch because the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-1 standard states
them that way. The <b>ustar</b> format includes only <i>mtime</i>; the new format adds <i>atime</i> and <i>ctime</i> for symmetry.
The <i>atime</i> access time restored to the file system will be affected by the <b>-p</b> <b>a</b> and <b>-p</b> <b>e</b> options.
The <i>ctime</i> creation time (actually <i>inode</i> modification time) is described with appropriate privileges so that it can be
ignored when writing to the file system. POSIX does not provide a portable means to change file creation time. Nothing is intended
to prevent a non-portable implementation of <i>pax</i> from restoring the value.</p>

<p>The <i>gid</i>, <i>size</i>, and <i>uid</i> extended header records were included to allow expansion beyond the sizes specified
in the regular <i>tar</i> header. New file system architectures are emerging that will exhaust the 12-digit size field. There are
probably not many systems requiring more than 8 digits for user and group IDs, but the extended header values were included for
completeness, allowing overrides for all of the decimal values in the <i>tar</i> header.</p>

<p>The standard developers intended to describe the effective results of <i>pax</i> with regard to file ownerships and permissions;
implementations are not restricted in timing or sequencing the restoration of such, provided the results are as specified.</p>

<p>Much of the text describing the extended headers refers to use in &quot; <b>write</b> or <b>copy</b> modes&quot;. The <b>copy</b> mode
references are due to the normative text: &quot;The effect of the copy shall be as if the copied files were written to an archive file
and then subsequently extracted ...&quot;. There is certainly no way to test whether <i>pax</i> is actually generating the extended
headers in <b>copy</b> mode, but the effects must be as if it had.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_18_02"></a>pax Archive Character Set Encoding/Decoding</h5>

<p>There is a need to exchange archives of files between systems of different native codesets. Filenames, group names, and user
names must be preserved to the fullest extent possible when an archive is read on the receiving platform. Translation of the
contents of files is not within the scope of the <i>pax</i> utility.</p>

<p>There will also be the need to represent characters that are not available on the receiving platform. These unsupported
characters cannot be automatically folded to the local set of characters due to the chance of collisions. This could result in
overwriting previous extracted files from the archive or pre-existing files on the system.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the codeset used to represent characters within the extended header records of the <i>pax</i> archive must be
sufficiently rich to handle all commonly used character sets. The fields requiring translation include, at a minimum, filenames,
user names, group names, and link pathnames. Implementations may wish to have localized extended keywords that use non-portable
characters.</p>

<p>The standard developers considered the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The archive creator specifies the well-defined name of the source codeset. The receiver must then recognize the codeset name and
perform the appropriate translations to the destination codeset.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The archive creator includes within the archive the character mapping table for the source codeset used to encode extended
header records. The receiver must then read the character mapping table and perform the appropriate translations to the destination
codeset.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The archive creator translates the extended header records in the source codeset into a canonical form. The receiver must then
perform the appropriate translations to the destination codeset.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The approach that incorporates the name of the source codeset poses the problem of codeset name registration, and makes the
archive useless to <i>pax</i> archive decoders that do not recognize that codeset.</p>

<p>Because parts of an archive may be corrupted, the standard developers felt that including the character map of the source
codeset was too fragile. The loss of this one key component could result in making the entire archive useless. (The difference
between this and the global extended header decision was that the latter has a workaround-duplicating extended header records on
unreliable media-but this would be too burdensome for large character set maps.)</p>

<p>Both of the above approaches also put an undue burden on the <i>pax</i> archive receiver to handle the cross-product of all
source and destination codesets.</p>

<p>To simplify the translation from the source codeset to the canonical form and from the canonical form to the destination
codeset, the standard developers decided that the internal representation should be a stateless encoding. A stateless encoding is
one where each codepoint has the same meaning, without regard to the decoder being in a specific state. An example of a stateful
encoding would be the Japanese Shift-JIS; an example of a stateless encoding would be the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard
(equivalent to 7-bit ASCII).</p>

<p>For these reasons, the standard developers decided to adopt a canonical format for the representation of file information
strings. The obvious, well-endorsed candidate is the ISO/IEC&nbsp;10646-1:2000 standard (based in part on Unicode), which can be
used to represent the characters of virtually all standardized character sets. The standard developers initially agreed upon using
UCS2 (16-bit Unicode) as the internal representation. This repertoire of characters provides a sufficiently rich set to represent
all commonly-used codesets.</p>

<p>However, the standard developers found that the 16-bit Unicode representation had some problems. It forced the issue of
standardizing byte ordering. The 2-byte length of each character made the extended header records twice as long for the case of
strings coded entirely from historical 7-bit ASCII. For these reasons, the standard developers chose the UTF-8 defined in the
ISO/IEC&nbsp;10646-1:2000 standard. This multi-byte representation encodes UCS2 or UCS4 characters reliably and deterministically,
eliminating the need for a canonical byte ordering. In addition, NUL octets and other characters possibly confusing to POSIX file
systems do not appear, except to represent themselves. It was realized that certain national codesets take up more space after the
encoding, due to their placement within the UCS range; it was felt that the usefulness of the encoding of the names outweighs the
disadvantage of size increase for file, user, and group names.</p>

<p>The encoding of UTF-8 is as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>UCS4 Hex Encoding  UTF-8 Binary Encoding
<br>
00000000-0000007F  0xxxxxxx
00000080-000007FF  110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
00000800-0000FFFF  1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
00010000-001FFFFF  11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
00200000-03FFFFFF  111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
04000000-7FFFFFFF  1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
</tt>
</pre>

<p>where each <tt>'x'</tt> represents a bit value from the character being translated.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_18_03"></a>ustar Interchange Format</h5>

<p>The description of the <b>ustar</b> format reflects numerous enhancements over pre-1988 versions of the historical <i>tar</i>
utility. The goal of these changes was not only to provide the functional enhancements desired, but also to retain compatibility
between new and old versions. This compatibility has been retained. Archives written using the old archive format are compatible
with the new format.</p>

<p>Implementors should be aware that the previous file format did not include a mechanism to archive directory type files. For this
reason, the convention of using a filename ending with &lt;slash&gt; was adopted to specify a directory on the archive.</p>

<p>The total size of the <i>name</i> and <i>prefix</i> fields have been set to meet the minimum requirements for {PATH_MAX}. If a
pathname will fit within the <i>name</i> field, it is recommended that the pathname be stored there without the use of the
<i>prefix</i> field. Although the name field is known to be too small to contain {PATH_MAX} characters, the value was not changed
in this version of the archive file format to retain backwards-compatibility, and instead the prefix was introduced. Also, because
of the earlier version of the format, there is no way to remove the restriction on the <i>linkname</i> field being limited in size
to just that of the <i>name</i> field.</p>

<p>The <i>size</i> field is required to be meaningful in all implementation extensions, although it could be zero. This is required
so that the data blocks can always be properly counted.</p>

<p>It is suggested that if device special files need to be represented that cannot be represented in the standard format, that one
of the extension types (<b>A</b>- <b>Z</b>) be used, and that the additional information for the special file be represented as
data and be reflected in the <i>size</i> field.</p>

<p>Attempting to restore a special file type, where it is converted to ordinary data and conflicts with an existing filename, need
not be specially detected by the utility. If run as an ordinary user, <i>pax</i> should not be able to overwrite the entries in,
for example, <b>/dev</b> in any case (whether the file is converted to another type or not). If run as a privileged user, it should
be able to do so, and it would be considered a bug if it did not. The same is true of ordinary data files and similarly named
special files; it is impossible to anticipate the needs of the user (who could really intend to overwrite the file), so the
behavior should be predictable (and thus regular) and rely on the protection system as required.</p>

<p>The value 7 in the <i>typeflag</i> field is intended to define how contiguous files can be stored in a <b>ustar</b> archive.
POSIX.1-2017 does not require the contiguous file extension, but does define a standard way of archiving such files so that all
conforming systems can interpret these file types in a meaningful and consistent manner. On a system that does not support extended
file types, the <i>pax</i> utility should do the best it can with the file and go on to the next.</p>

<p>The file protection modes are those conventionally used by the <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> utility. This is
extended beyond the usage in the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2 standard to support the &quot;shared text&quot; or &quot;sticky&quot; bit. It is intended that
the conformance document should not document anything beyond the existence of and support of such a mode. Further extensions are
expected to these bits, particularly with overloading the set-user-ID and set-group-ID flags.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_18_04"></a>cpio Interchange Format</h5>

<p>The reference to appropriate privileges in the <b>cpio</b> format refers to an error on standard output; the <b>ustar</b> format
does not make comparable statements.</p>

<p>The model for this format was the historical System V <i>cpio</i> <b>-c</b> data interchange format. This model documents the
portable version of the <b>cpio</b> format and not the binary version. It has the flexibility to transfer data of any type
described within POSIX.1-2017, yet is extensible to transfer data types specific to extensions beyond POSIX.1-2017 (for example,
contiguous files). Because it describes existing practice, there is no question of maintaining upwards-compatibility.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_18_05"></a>cpio Header</h5>

<p>There has been some concern that the size of the <i>c_ino</i> field of the header is too small to handle those systems that have
very large <i>inode</i> numbers. However, the <i>c_ino</i> field in the header is used strictly as a hard-link resolution mechanism
for archives. It is not necessarily the same value as the <i>inode</i> number of the file in the location from which that file is
extracted.</p>

<p>The name <i>c_magic</i> is based on historical usage.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_20_92_18_06"></a>cpio Filename</h5>

<p>For most historical implementations of the <i>cpio</i> utility, {PATH_MAX} octets can be used to describe the pathname without
the addition of any other header fields (the NUL character would be included in this count). {PATH_MAX} is the minimum value for
pathname size, documented as 256 bytes. However, an implementation may use <i>c_namesize</i> to determine the exact length of the
pathname. With the current description of the <a href="../basedefs/cpio.h.html"><i>&lt;cpio.h&gt;</i></a> header, this pathname
size can be as large as a number that is described in six octal digits.</p>

<p>Two values are documented under the <i>c_mode</i> field values to provide for extensibility for known file types:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>0110&nbsp;000</b></dt>

<dd>Reserved for contiguous files. The implementation may treat the rest of the information for this archive like a regular file.
If this file type is undefined, the implementation may create the file as a regular file.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This provides for extensibility of the <b>cpio</b> format while allowing for the ability to read old archives. Files of an
unknown type may be read as &quot;regular files&quot; on some implementations. On a system that does not support extended file types, the
<i>pax</i> utility should do the best it can with the file and go on to the next.</p>
