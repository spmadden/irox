RIR Statistics Exchange Format

This specification defines the file production cycle, naming and
content for the RIR statistics files.

The RIR statistics files summarize the current state of allocations
and assignments of Internet number resources. They are intended to
provide a snapshot of the status of Internet number resources,
without any transactional or historical details.

This format replaces the previous statistics exchange format, and
differs from it in significant ways.

The details of this format are to be considered a published RIR
standard, on which other parties are expected to rely. RIRs must
comply with this standard in every respect.


1. Production Process

    Each RIR periodically produces a text file of records as
    described below, representing all of the allocations and
    assignments which have been made by that RIR to that date.

    This file is to be produced daily. The last time of any record
    for the file is 23:59:59 in the local time zone of the producing
    RIR.  (i.e. the last possible time on the specified calendar
    day in that time zone)

    An MD5 checksum is to be computed on the file, and published
    under a matching name, with file extension .md5 appended.

    A PGP or other cryptographically strong signature can also be
    computed, and published under a matching name with suitable
    extension.


2. File naming and exchange

    2.1 File name:

    Each file is called delegated-<registry>-yyyymmdd

    The <registry> value follows the internal record format and is
    one of the specified strings from the set:

     {apnic,arin,iana,lacnic,ripencc};

    This set may be altered to add, remove or modify registries.

    The yyyymmdd is the date, local not UCT, on which the file was
    produced.

    The file is marked delegated-<registry> to discriminate it from
    any other <registry> files produced in another context. These
    would be expected to be named in a different file-tree, but if
    accidentally placed in the same directory would cause no data loss.

    Data compression is optional. If compressed, the normal file
    suffix is used to denote the compression algorithm. (.gz, .bz2, .zip etc)

    The most recent file (named as follows) must be available in
    a non-compressed form.

    The most recent file will also be available under a name of
    the form delegated-<registry>-latest. This can be a symbolic
    or hard link to the delegated-<registry>-yyyymmdd file but must
    be pointed at the most recent file when it is updated.

    This is to permit automatic fetching of the current data via
    a persistent URL, in systems jobs, or in browser bookmarks or
    other stored form.

    2.2 File exchange:

    Each RIR will make its files available in a standard ftp
    directory, defined as /stats/<registry>/*. Data will be lodged 
    within 3 business days (locally for each RIR) of the date of 
    the file, in the source RIR location. 

    The RIR may mirror each others data.  If an RIR does mirror 
    files from others RIRs, the standard path directory remains 
    the same, i.e., /stats/<registry>/* where <registry> is the 
    RIR being mirrored.

    2.3 File availability:

    Data will be available by FTP, and additionally by any other
    access method the RIR chooses. This may include alternative
    URLs, but these will reflect the common naming model. Data will
    be publicly visible and will not require access control (world-
    readable).

    Examples:

        http://www.apnic.net/stats/<registry>/delegated-<registry>-latest
        rsync www.apnic.net::/stats/<registry>/delegated-<registry>-latest
        ftp://ftp.apnic.net/pub/stats/<registry>/delegated-<registry>-latest

    (The use of a standard prefix in a URL such as /pub/ in FTP
    servers is not considered obligatory, and does not define the
    URL for use in HTTP or other access methods. The defined URL
    base is /stats/<registry>/ across all application-specific
    access methods.)


3. File format

    The file consists of comments, file header lines, and records,
    one record per line. Header and record lines are structured as
    'comma separated fields' (CSV), with leading and trailing blank text
    in fields not meaningful.

    The vertical line character '|' (ASCII code 0x7c) is used as the
    CSV field separator.

    After the header lines, records are not sorted.

    3.1 Comments:

    Comments are denoted by # at the beginning of a line. No
    line-embedded comments are permitted. Comments may occur at
    any place in the file.

    Example:

         #optional comments.
         #   any number of lines.

         #another optional comment.

    Blank lines are permitted, and may occur at any place in the file.

    3.2 File header:

    The file header consists of the version line and the summary
    lines for each type of record. There must be only one version
    line, which must be the first line of the header. There must
    be at exactly one summary line for each type of record which
    appears in the file.

    3.2.1 The Version line:

    Format:


         version|registry|serial|records|startdate|enddate|UTCoffset

    version    = format version number of this file, currently 2;
    registry   = as for records and filename (see below);
    serial     = serial number of this file (within the creating RIR series);
    records    = number of records in file, excluding blank lines,
                     summary lines, the version line and comments;
    startdate  = start date of time period, in yyyymmdd format;
    enddate    = end date of period, in yyyymmdd format;
    UTCoffset  = offset from UTC of local RIR producing file, 
                     in +/- HHMM format.

    3.2.2 The Summary line:

    The summary lines count the number of record lines of each type in the file.

    Format:

         registry|*|type|*|count|summary

    registry   = as for records (see below);
    *          = an ASCII '*' (unused field, retained for spreadsheet purposes);
    type       = as for records (defined below);
    count      = the number of record lines of this type in the file;
    summary    = the ASCII string 'summary' (to distinguish the record line).


    Note that the count does not equate to the total amount of
    resources for each class of record. This is to be computed from
    the records themselves.

    3.3 Record format:

    After the defined file header, and excluding any space or
    comments, each line in the file represents a single allocation
    (or assignment) of a specific range of Internet number resources
    (IPv4, IPv6 or ASN), made by the RIR identified in the record.

    In the case of IPv4 the records may represent non-CIDR ranges
    or CIDR blocks, and therefore the record format represents a
    beginning of range, and a count. This can be converted to
    prefix/length using simple algorithms.

    In the case of IPv6 the record format represents the prefix
    and the count of /128 instances under that prefix.

    Format:

         registry|cc|type|start|value|date|status[|extensions...]

    registry  = One value from the set of defined strings:

                        {apnic,arin,iana,lacnic,ripencc};

    cc        = ISO 2-letter country code of the organization to which the
                allocation or assignment was made, and the enumerated
                variances of

                        {AP,EU,UK}

                These values are not defined in ISO 3166 but are widely used.

    type      = Type of Internet number resource represented in this record,
                One value from the set of defined strings:

                        {asn,ipv4,ipv6}

    start     = In the case of records of type 'ipv4' or 'ipv6'
                this is the IPv4 or IPv6 'first address' of the range.

		In the case of an 16 bit AS number  the format is
		the integer value in the range 0 to 65535, in the
		case of a 32 bit ASN the value is in the range 0
		to 4294967296. No distinction is drawn between 16
		and 32 bit ASN values in the range 0 to 65535.

    value     = In the case of IPv4 address the count of hosts for
                this range. This count does not have to represent a
                CIDR range.

                In the case of an IPv6 address the value will be
                the CIDR prefix length from the 'first address'
                value of <start>.
                In the case of records of type 'asn' the number is
                the count of AS from this start value.

    date      = Date on this allocation/assignment was made by the
                RIR in the format YYYYMMDD;

                Where the allocation or assignment has been
                transferred from another registry, this date
                represents the date of first assignment or allocation
                as received in from the original RIR.

                It is noted that where records do not show a date of
                first assignment, this can take the 00000000 value.

    status    = Type of allocation from the set:

                        {allocated, assigned}

                This is the allocation or assignment made by the
                registry producing the file and not any sub-assignment
                by other agencies. 

   extensions = Any extra data on a line is undefined, but should conform
                to use of the field separator used above.


4. Validation/assumptions

    Validation is assisted by the file headers, using the "records"
    field.  Also by checking the file name against its contents,
    and by use of the detached MD5 and/or other checksum files.

    Within any one file. there should be no overlap of assigned
    records by their base address and count or prefix length. During
    the transfer of management of a resource from one RIR to another,
    it is possible that there will be overlapping records when
    comparing each file.

    It is assumed that any one file only contains records with
    registry field set to the value of the file-producing RIR.

    Early Registration Transfers (ERX) do not have any special
    tagging in this format. As resource management responsibility
    moves between the RIR then resource records will move between
    stats files. ERX records are expected to move from the old to
    the new registry at the end of any defined transfer window.
    This minimizes the risk of data overlap and avoids unnecessary
    changes to data.


5.  Non-Registry allocated and assigned data

    Historical assignments which are not under regional Internet 
    registry management will not be included in the RIR produced files.

    An instance of the known state of these 'IANA' assignments will be
    incorporated in the mirroring system if maintained by IANA.


6.  Extensions to the format

    Extensions to this format may be made by mutual agreement among 
    the participating registries.


7.  MD5 Hash File format

    As previously indicated, an MD5 checksum is to be computed on the file 
    and published under a matching name with the file extension .md5 appended. 
    The format of the hash file will be a single line formatted as follows:

        MD5 (<filename>) = <hash>

    where <filename> is the name of the file to which the hash applies 
    and <hash> is the calculated MD5 checksum.

    E.g.,  

        MD5 (delegated-apnic-20031119) = 64175f7e728732743b3acc28c00c2179

8.  Cryptographic signing

    As previously stipulated, a PGP or other cryptographically strong 
    signature may also be computed and published under a matching 
    name with suitable extension.

    8.1 Recommended method 

    The recommended method at this time is to sign the file using GPG 
    and to publish the signature under a matching file name with the file 
    extension .asc appended.  An example of a file signed in this manner
    follows:

        -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
        Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)
        Comment: For info see http://www.gnupg.org

        iEYEABECAAYFAj+6U64ACgkQyzQvAdFSThS5ZQCfcbE3+7UnaBe2SNysWrq+xpVB
        rZEAmwRdPkylmvhCNnt5th5jxHBmIngF
        =kxyA
        -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

    8.2 Publishing of public key

    If the RIR chooses to cryptographically sign the statistics file, 
    it is recommended that the public key needed to verify the signature 
    be published or a link to the public key be created in the same 
    directory location of the latest statistics and accompanying files. 

    The name of the public key file (or link thereto) should follow the 
    form delegated-<rir>-key where <rir> conforms to the values identified 
    in section 2.1. This will prevent confusion in the event that an RIR 
    uses distinct keys for signing different sets of published files.

    ARIN has retired its old key to delegated-arin-key_20080908 and 
    has replaced it with a new key in the delegated-arin-key file. 

9.  Data retention

    There is no obligation on any registry to retain previous files, once
    a new file is produced and lodged for public access.
